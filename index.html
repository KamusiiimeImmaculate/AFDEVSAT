    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        AfDevSat is a pan‑African Earth observation satellite initiative led by the Egyptian Space Agency (EgSA), in collaboration with national agencies in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Ghana, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Launched in August 2019 during TICAD‑7 in Yokohama and endorsed at COPUOS later that year, the project unites participating countries to develop satellite subsystems locally, assemble them in Egypt, and deploy a small constellation focused on climate change, disaster response, agriculture, and water resource monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        In January 2025, EgSA began a training programme for 21 engineers from 20 African countries, strengthening continental satellite development capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
        By May 2025, Uganda hosted the inaugural AfDevSat workshop, bringing together representatives from Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, and Ghana. The event formalized shared roadmaps on technical development, funding, policy coordination, and expansion plans.
    </p>
    <p>
        The satellite will carry two Earth-observation payloads: a 7 m panchromatic camera and a 30 m multispectral imager, with a planned operational life of about two years. It will provide timely data for climate resilience, food security, environmental protection, and disaster management across Africa.
