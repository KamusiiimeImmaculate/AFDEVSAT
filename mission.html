      <h2>Mission: </h2>
      <p>The mission of the African Development Satellite (AfDevSat) initiative is to build and operate a satellite for environmental and climate monitoring tailored to Africa's needs. It aims to foster collaboration, capability building, and technological advancement in the space sector.</p>
      <h2>Objectives:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhance Africa’s capacity in satellite design and operations.</li>
        <li>Monitor climate change impacts like drought, floods, and land degradation.</li>
        <li>Support evidence-based policy for agriculture, water, and disaster management.</li>
        <li>Facilitate knowledge sharing and training across participating countries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Vision:</h2>
      <p>The AfDevSat initiative aligns with the broader African Space Policy and African Space Strategy, as well as the recent establishment of the African Space Agency (AfSA). Furthermore, the initiative is a vital component of efforts to enhance the technical capabilities of African nations, enabling them to become self-reliant in developing and operating space systems.</p>
      <p>AfDevSat’s ultimate goal is to create a collaborative framework where knowledge sharing and capability building drive innovation and independence in Africa’s growing space industry. The collaborating nations bring together their expertise and infrastructure to support specialised training and partnerships.</p>
