      <h2>Mission & Objectives</h2>
      <p>The mission of AfDevSat is to build and operate a satellite for environmental and climate monitoring tailored to African development needs. It aims to foster inter-African collaboration, capacity building, and technological advancement in the space sector.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhance Africa’s capacity in satellite design and operations.</li>
        <li>Monitor climate change impacts like drought, floods, and land degradation.</li>
        <li>Support evidence-based policy for agriculture, water, and disaster management.</li>
        <li>Facilitate knowledge sharing and training across participating countries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Vision Behind AfDev-Sat</h2>
      <p>The AfDev-Sat initiative aligns with Egypt’s broader role as a key player in African space integration, exemplified by its hosting of the African Space Agency (AfSA) following its successful bid in February 2019. Furthermore, the programme is a vital component of efforts to enhance the technical capabilities of African nations, enabling them to become self-reliant in developing and operating space systems.</p>
      <p>AfDev-Sat’s ultimate goal is to create a collaborative framework where knowledge sharing and capacity building drive innovation and independence in Africa’s burgeoning space industry. Thus, EgSA aims to bridge gaps in expertise and infrastructure across the continent by providing specialised training and fostering partnerships.</p>
    
      <h2>Why Africa Needs AfDev-Sat?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The climate change is one of the main challenges for the upcoming decades.</li>
        <li>The devastating effects of climate change, from longer periods of drought, more frequent wildfires and loss of sea ice to an increase in the number, duration and intensity of tropical storms, are being felt around the world with an intensity that underscores the immediate need for concerted efforts.</li>
        <li>In March and April 2019, cyclones tore through the Southern African countries of Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, taking the lives of hundreds and injuring and displacing thousands.</li>
        <li>According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the natural disaster affected more than 1.9 million people across the region, most requiring humanitarian assistance</li>
      </ul>
